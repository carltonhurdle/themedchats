# themedchats
Using Socket.IO, Node, Express, BootstrapCSS, Giphy and some custom CSS, with the help of great Socket.IO documentation and several tutorials online, here's a cute little chat. 

You can customize it by changing the giphy to fit any themed site. Depending on colors, you may want to change the white text.

Enjoy!
